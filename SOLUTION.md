# Solution Steps

1. Define the Post type in a shared file (types/post.ts) for type-safe transfer between API and client.

2. Implement pages/api/posts.ts: Define a mock posts array, simulate possible delay and occasional failure, and respond with strictly-typed JSON.

3. Implement pages/api/notify.ts: Add a POST-only endpoint to simulate a background notification (with a small delay).

4. In pages/index.tsx, use useEffect to fetch '/api/posts' asynchronously on mount and track loading, error, and posts state. Cast data to Post[], handle all error/loading cases, and never render 'undefined' data.

5. Trigger a fire-and-forget call to '/api/notify' using POST after successful posts loading, without awaiting or blocking render.

6. Use the Post type everywhere to avoid all TypeScript errors.

7. In the UI, display loading indicator, errors, or strictly valid post entries. Format author/date clearly and ensure no field renders as undefined.

8. Verify that slow or failing APIs are handled gracefully â€“ UI must not freeze or display incomplete data.
